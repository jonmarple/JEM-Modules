# JEM-Modules
Collection of my personal modular synth modules for VCV Rack.  
Faceplates are in need of an update so you can see what each module is, but they are functioning otherwise.  
  
## VCO-1
    Simple voltage controlled oscillator with a sine wave output, voltage input, and pitch knob.    
## VCA
    Simple voltage controlled amplifier with in/outs, mod input, and a level knob.    
## Trigger
    Launch button to trigger gates or other inputs. Has a launch function to hold the gate and four separate outputs.
